Ideas for further development
=============================

* brighter UI
* align week day name headers correctly
* solve issue of too large graphics on some devices
* flash only selected day instead of full screen on "goto now"
* show over weeks list which is the part that agenda displays
* selection of which calendars to display
* hint somehow which event is from which calendar
* Highlight eventful days on weekview
* Search from events. Future events is the default.
* Finnish localization
* Changeable color schemes (from a few hard-coded ones, e.g. dark, light)

Bugs
====

* Long press on agenda day gives new event creation view which starts from 00:00.
